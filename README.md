#### Projects and adaptations

1. First created REVERSE STRING to reverse a string of input from a user using the Scanner class in Java. After doing this, I attempted creating a "Palindrome checker" (a simple extension from creating a program that reverses a string of input).
   Simply used the .equalsIgnoreCase() method to verify if the strings are identical running forwards and backwards, i.e., palindromes.
    
   Need to look into ignoring commas and other punctuation.
